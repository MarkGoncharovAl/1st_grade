# Safe_iterator #

### Starting ###
	
You should just copied the Safe_Iter.h to the programm folder and include it with ""
	
### Opportunity ###
	
There is no more that just convinient pattern for iterators, because when I was working at project "Language" I found out that if you're working with strings so long, you want to help strong guarantee that your programm won't fall every 5 minutes. 

Moreover, it can help you to find where exactly mistake is (use must_change often or just check output of every operations).

That's all - just cool tool, read declaration - I hope you will understand everything!
