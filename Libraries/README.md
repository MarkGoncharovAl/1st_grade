I've made this in order to use it if neccessary - Don't want to create a cycle every time

### Short description ###

##### 1)	Array2D - convenient 2D array #####
The main advantage: size_x, size_y can be declared during programm execution (mas[][] can't). Also array has many types of iterators. Check this out!  

##### 2)	BMH - algorithm Boyer-Moore-Horspool #####
Use for finding pattern in the big (or even not so) string. There are some extra opportunity...
Interested in - come in, it's waiting for you there

##### 3)	Graph - struct for graph programms #####
Every Node has: name, inner_data, output_nodes, input_nodes. Now edges of graph hasn't got any inner_data - it wasn't significant target. If I'll free I would do this. In other cases it's convenient graph (not fast)

##### 4)	Safe_Iter - Safe realization of iterator + some features #####
Use it if you're working with the string so often and you're tired of checking end, remeber where the start of string is, writing ++, and so on. 
Look at there if you're not a coward

##### 5)Span - array + iterator together #####
Short and convinient opportunity to work with arrays and iterators fast and safe. There are many possibities to use.
